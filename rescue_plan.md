If you're getting this message it's because John Doe was supposed to be back at 2024-12-22 18:00 but did not disable this alert before that time. This doesn't necessarily mean that they are lost or injured in the field. They may have simply forgotten to disable this alert or may be running a little late. Try to get ahold of them as soon as you can. If you cannot get ahold of them within a reasonable amount of time, please contact your local search and rescue and share this information with them.
