# Describe where you are going in as much detail as possible.
where: "We are heading to Redwood National and State Parks to hike the James Irvine Trail to Fern Canyon loop. We will be parking at the limited full-day parking lot near the Prairie Creek Visitor Center."

# Enter the date and time that you are departing and when you should return in ISO 8061 format with time zone offset (e.g. 2024-12-19 10:33 -0800).
# Experts recommend you add a buffer to your return time. For example, if you plan to come back at noon, give yourself three to six hours to play with and say youâ€™ll return at 3 P.M. or 6 P.M. This allows extra time to have fun, fix the flat tire, or accomplish whatever might happen that can be dealt with alone before activating tons of rescue personnel.
